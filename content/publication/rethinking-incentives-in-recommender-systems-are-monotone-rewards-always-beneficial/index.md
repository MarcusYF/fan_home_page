abstract: "The past decade has witnessed the flourishing of a new profession as
  media content creators, who rely on revenue streams from online content
  recommendation platforms. The reward mechanism employed by these platforms
  creates a competitive environment among creators which affect their production
  choices and, consequently, content distribution and system welfare. It is thus
  crucial to design the platform's reward mechanism in order to steer the
  creators' competition towards a desirable welfare outcome in the long run.
  This work makes two major contributions in this regard: first, we uncover a
  fundamental limit about a class of widely adopted mechanisms, coined
  Merit-based Monotone Mechanisms, by showing that they inevitably lead to a
  constant fraction loss of the welfare. To circumvent this limitation, we
  introduce Backward Rewarding Mechanisms (BRMs) and show that the competition
  games resulting from BRM possess a potential game structure, which naturally
  induces the strategic creators' behavior dynamics to optimize any given
  welfare metric. In addition, the class of BRM can be parameterized so that it
  allows the platform to directly optimize welfare within the feasible mechanism
  space even when the welfare metric is not explicitly defined."
