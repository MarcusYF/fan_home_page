abstract: "Content creators compete for exposure on recommendation platforms,
  and such strategic behavior leads to a dynamic shift over the content
  distribution. However, how the creators' competition impacts user welfare and
  how the relevance-driven recommendation influences the dynamics in the long
  run are still largely unknown. This work provides theoretical insights into
  these research questions. We model the creators' competition under the
  assumptions that: 1) the platform employs an innocuous top-K recommendation
  policy; 2) user decisions follow the Random Utility model; 3) content creators
  compete for user engagement and, without knowing their utility function in
  hindsight, apply arbitrary no-regret learning algorithms to update their
  strategies. We study the user welfare guarantee through the lens of Price of
  Anarchy and show that the fraction of user welfare loss due to creator
  competition is always upper bounded by a small constant depending on K and
  randomness in user decisions; we also prove the tightness of this bound. Our
  result discloses an intrinsic merit of the myopic approach to the
  recommendation, i.e., relevance-driven matching performs reasonably well in
  the long run, as long as users' decisions involve randomness and the platform
  provides reasonably many alternatives to its users."
