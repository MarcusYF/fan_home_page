## Tennis

I'm a crazy tennis lover and I play competitive UTR matches with an official rating about [UTR 5.4](https://app.utrsports.net/profiles/4288689). Interesting and useful links

## Singing
I am an amateur singer who is dedicated to continuously improving my vocal skills. Inspired by my favorite artist, Jay Chou, I strive to capture the emotion and artistry in his music. Over the years, I have developed a collection of my own representative works, showcasing my progress and passion for singing.

## Cooking

I love cooking. For me, cooking is never about following the recipes but an intellectual work filled with imagination and creativity. In some sense, the kitchen is like a chemistry lab to me. I enjoy investigating the nature of different ingredients and the rationale behind different cooking styles from various cultures. 

## Photography

I like to unveil different corners of the earth and take photos. Here are some magnificent views I would like to share.
