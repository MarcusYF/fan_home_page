I am a final-year PhD candidate in [CS at UVa](https://engineering.virginia.edu/department/computer-science) and will be joining [STOR at UNC](https://stor.unc.edu/) as a tenure-track assistant professor in Fall 2025. My advisors are Prof. [Haifeng Xu](https://www.haifeng-xu.com/) and Prof. [Hongning Wang](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~hw5x/). Currently I'm interested in modeling human-AI interactions, with the goal of understanding their societal implications and designing interventions that promote social good. If you are interested in collaboration, feel free to drop an email!

<!--Before my Ph.D journey, I worked at [Alibaba](www.alibaba.com), where I built recommender systems for [Taobao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taobao), the world's largest e-commerce platform. Prior to that, I obtained my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in computational mathematics from [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn). -->
