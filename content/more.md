## Tennis

I'm a crazy tennis lover, and my level is about NTRP 3.5-4.0. I'm a member of the ABC tennis club in Charlottesville region and have always been practicing to horn my skills. Though I use the two-handed backhand, my favorite player is Roger Federer because I admire his swords-like forehand and enjoy finishing a point at the net. 

## My Cats

I raise two cats, Bonnie \& Clyde, with my wife. 

## Cooking

I love cooking. For me, cooking is never about following the recipes but an intellectual work filled with imagination and creativity. In some sense, the kitchen is like a chemistry lab to me. I enjoy investigating the nature of different ingredients and the rationale behind different cooking styles from various cultures. 

## Photography

I like to unveil different corners of the earth and take photos. Here are some magnificent views I would like to share.
