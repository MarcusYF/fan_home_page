I am a final year Ph.D. student in CS at [University of Virginia](https://engineering.virginia.edu/) and I will be on *academia job market* this Fall! My advisors are Prof. [Haifeng Xu](https://www.haifeng-xu.com/) (now at University of Chicago) and Prof. [Hongning Wang](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~hw5x/) (now at Tsinghua University). Prior to my Ph.D. journey, I worked as an algorithm engineer in [Alibaba Group](www.alibaba.com), building recommender systems for [Taobao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taobao), the world's largest eCommerce platform. Before that, I obtained my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in computational mathematics from [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn). My research interests include algorithmic game theory, machine learning, and their applications in recommendation ecosystems and online content markets.
