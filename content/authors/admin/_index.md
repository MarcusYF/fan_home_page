I am a final-year Ph.D candidate in CS at [UVa](https://engineering.virginia.edu/) and will soon be joining the [Department of Statistics & Operations Research at UNC Chapel Hill] (https://stor.unc.edu/) as a tenure-track assistant professor. My advisors are Prof. [Haifeng Xu](https://www.haifeng-xu.com/) and Prof. [Hongning Wang](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~hw5x/). Before my Ph.D journey, I worked at [Alibaba](www.alibaba.com), where I built recommender systems for [Taobao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taobao), the world's largest e-commerce platform. Prior to that, I obtained my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in computational mathematics from [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn). My current research interest lies in modeling human-AI interactions, with the goal of understanding their societal implications and designing interventions that promote social good. If you are interested in collaborating, feel free to drop an email!
